# 🚀 Object-Oriented Programming (C++) Lab

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Programming (C++) Lab** repository! 🎉 This repository contains various assignments and experiments focused on mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** in **C++**.

---

## 📌 About the Lab
📘 This lab covers fundamental to advanced OOP concepts, including **classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and more**. The goal is to strengthen C++ programming skills through hands-on exercises.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Requirements
✅ **C++ Compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)  
✅ **IDE** (Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, CLion, or any C++ editor)  
✅ **Git** for version control  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/Object-Oriented-Programming-Cpp-Lab.git
 cd Object-Oriented-Programming-Cpp-Lab
```
### 2️⃣ Compile & Run
- Open a terminal and navigate to the respective experiment folder.
- Compile using a C++ compiler:
```sh
 g++ filename.cpp 
 ./a.out
```

## 💡 Why Learn Object-Oriented Programming?

✨ **Real-World Modeling:** OOP allows us to represent real-world entities as objects, making code more intuitive and closer to natural problem-solving.  
✨ **Code Reusability:** Concepts like **inheritance** let us reuse existing code, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.  
✨ **Encapsulation & Security:** Data hiding through **private and protected members** enhances security and prevents unintended modifications.  
✨ **Scalability & Maintainability:** Well-structured OOP code is modular, making it easier to debug, maintain, and scale for larger applications.  
✨ **Polymorphism & Flexibility:** With **function overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions**, OOP provides great flexibility in handling different types of data and operations.
